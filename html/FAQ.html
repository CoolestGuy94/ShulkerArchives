    <h3>We need help!</h3>
    <p>Maintaining this is not easy, and it gets worse with every kit we add. If you have ideas for improving the
        archives, either open an Issue for them on the GitHub, or make the changes in a Pull Request.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>What Next?</h3>
    <p>We're nearing the end of the kits in antis plot. After this, kit import will slow down significantly, as we will
        need to scour through other collections to find new kits. I (Kaddicus) am both relieved and concerned about
        this, as it means I don't have to add as many kits every day to avoid backlog, but it also means a headache of
        sorting through hundreds if not thousands of kits collected by other people, and separating the ones we don't
        already have. Given 3 going on 4 months of my life has been consumed by this project, delaying numerous other
        things I wanted to do, I'm not really looking forward to the immediate future.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>So, you've found the Archives, maybe even downloaded an NBT File or two, and are wondering how to use
                them.</p>
            <p>Or maybe you know how to use them, but are curious about editing and creating your own files.</p>
            <p>Hopefully this page will show you everything you need to know about everything NBT :)</p>
            <p>Check the Sidebar on the left for a clickable overview of this page.</p>

        <section id="Prerequisites" class="UsingNBT">
            <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
            <p>To get started with anything NBT related, you'll need a few basic mods:</p>
            <li><a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/nbt-editor/version/1.10.0">NBT Editor ≥1.10.0</a> by mega12345mega
            </li>

                Sjouwer
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/adaptive-tooltips/version/1.1.1">Adaptive Tooltips ≥1.1.1</a> by
                isXander
            </li>
            <p>These three mods are absolutely essential for working with NBT, and all users of the Archives should
                have them.</p>
            <p>More advanced and niche Mods (and external applications) will be listed below in their relevant
                sections, and all Resources can be found at the bottom of this page in the Index, as well as on the
                Resources page.</p>

        <section id="UsingNBTFiles" class="UsingNBT">
            <h2>Using .nbt Files</h2>
            <p>The core of the Archives: .nbt files. But how do you use them?</p>
            <p>Well, it's simple.</p>
            <p>If you followed the prior section, you should have the NBT Editor mod installed in your Minecraft
                instance.</p>
            <p>To use a .nbt file, open your inventory, and then drag-and-drop the .nbt file(s) on to your Minecraft
                screen.</p>
            <p>NBT Editor should automatically add the Kit or Item contained in the .nbt file into your Inventory,
                using the first available slot(s).</p>

            <h2>Creating your own Kits & Items</h2>
            <p>You've got other peoples Kits and Items, and now you want to make your own... but how can you do
                that?</p>
            <p>Well, while we can't tell you what to create, we can give you some pointers and tools to use.</p>

        <section id="CreatingKitsItems--IBEEditor" class="UsingNBT">
            <h3>IBE Editor</h3>
            <p>Mentioned above under 'Using SNBT', <a
                    href="https://modrinth.com/mod/ibe-editor/version/2.2.2%2B1.19.3-fabric">IBE Editor</a> is one
                of the best mods currently available for
                editing Items; Whether
                you want to quickly adjust the Name and Lore, fiddle around with Enchantments and Attributes, or do
                a deep dive into the
                NBT Tags, IBE Editor is the mod to do it with.</p>

        <section id="CreatingKitsItems--FZMM" class="UsingNBT">
            <h3>FZMM</h3>
            <p><a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/fzmm/version/0.1.2">FZMM</a> is a curious little mod, offering a
                handful of fairly niche but incredibly useful utilities.</p>
            <p>The most useful of its utilities for Item-making however, is the Text Format module, which offers an
                amazingly intricate
                and detailed menu to create text, while also being quite intuitive. The cherry on top? It can export
                your created text
                as Lore, Item Name, or just copy it to your clipboard!</p>

        <section id="CreatingKitsItems--YourImagination" class="UsingNBT">
            <h3>Your Imagination</h3>
            <p>Many things are important in Item Making... but above all else, use your imagination. Look at other
                peoples kits as inspiration, not goals.</p>
            <p>Don't be discouraged if you don't understand all the aspects of NBT Editing, or are confused when
                someone mentions
                things like NaN Attribute Amounts or Damage Frames; It takes time to learn about the intricacies of
                NBT Editing.</p>
            <p>Remember, if you ever have questions, feel free to ask on The Shulker Archives Discord server; Even
                if someone here
                doesn't know the answer, we'd be more than happy to help find the answer.</p>

        <section id="StoringKitsItems" class="UsingNBT">
            <h2>Storing Kits & Items</h2>
            <p>You now have obtained Kits and Items from the Archives, and hopefully created your own... but now how
                can you save them?</p>
            <p>Placing them all down in one spot is a pain, and Hotbars are both limited and carry the very real
                danger of accidentally erasing one item while saving another.</p>
            <p>The mods you've installed along the way all come with some form of Storage or another, from NBT
                Editors 'Client Chest', to IBE Editors 'Vault', but all of them have their bugs and issues that
                prevent them from being the best.</p>
            <p>What, then, <i>is</i> the best? Why <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/jei/version/12.2.0.17">JEI</a>
                of course.</p>
            <p>JEI <i>aka</i> Just Enough Items, has an excellent feature called "Bookmarks".</p>
            <p>To use this, simply hover over anything in your Inventory, and press 'a'.</p>
            <p>Voila! The item is now saved in the 'Bookmarks' tab on the left.</p>
            <p>To obtain a bookmark, simply enable 'Cheat Mode' by CTRL + Left-Clicking the wrench in the lower
                right-hand side, and then Left or Right-Click a bookmark to obtain a copy of it.</p>
            <p><i><b>Please note that Items containing NaN/Inf attributes will NOT retain those attributes when
                obtained from Bookmarks, or any similar source that uses SNBT. Only Hotbars and .nbt files
                can successfully save Nan/Inf attributes.</b></i></p>

        <section id="ExportingKitsItems" class="UsingNBT">
            <h2>Exporting Kits & Items</h2>
            <p>There are two main ways to export your Kits and Items, each specific to what format you're exporting
                to.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="ExportingKitsItems--NBTFiles" class="UsingNBT">
            <h3>Exporting as .nbt files</h3>
            <p>The best way to export it (and the core method of these Archives) is as a .nbt file.</p>
            <p>To do so, you will need NBT Editor installed.</p>
            <p>While holding the Kit or Item you wish to export, open chat and type <code>/nbt export file</code>.
            </p>
            <p>Voila! It is now exported as a .nbt file, located in <code>.minecraft/nbteditor/exported/</code></p>

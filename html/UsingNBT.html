                     <h2>Beginner</h2>
                     <p>So, you came here, found a cool Kit or Item, and want to get it in Minecraft, but don't know how.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        That's where this guide comes in!
                     </p>
                     <p>In the following section, we'll look at the basics of using NBT Data to get cool Kits and Items in Minecraft, including the tools and commands needed.</p>
                     <h3>Setup</h3>
                     <p>The easiest way to add NBT in-game, is via a command. However, the command can be complicated or even impossible if you play Vanilla and/or have a really long string of NBT; For that reason, it's best to use a Modded setup for this.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Below is the recommended group of Mods you will need to start off
                     </p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Fabric</li>
                        <li>Fabric API</li>
                        <li>Meteor Client</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>There are fancier editors such as IBE, but they are far more complicated to use.</p>
                     <p>Once you have loaded into your world (or a server where you have sufficient privileges), take the item or container indicated in the archive, such as a red_shulker_box or diamond_sword, and hold it.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Next, open chat, and type <code>.nbt set </code> followed by the NBT copied from the archive.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If the text is all blue, then there are no issues, and you can go ahead an enter it. Enjoy your newly minted Kit or Item!
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If however the text is all red, then there is an issue with the command or NBT, and you need to begin again.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Should the text be all red even if you followed all steps correctly, please open an Issue using the Changes & Issues template, stating which Kit or Item you were attempting to make, and we'll see if there's an issue with the archived NBT.
                     </p>

                     <h2>Advanced</h2>
                     <p>This section is for more advanced users. If you haven't followed the Beginner Guide yet, please do not attempt this Advanced Guide. If you <i>have</i> followed the Beginner Guide, but don't intend on making Kits or Items, please do not attempt this Advanced Guide.
                        <br>
                        Basically, if you have zero intention of creating your own unique Kits and Items, stay away from this Advanced Guide. There is nothing here to benefit you
                     </p>

                     <h2>Known Bugs/Issues</h2>
                     <p>Below are known bugs/issues related to NBT Editing, and any known solutions for them.</p>
                     <br>
                     <h3>oshi.architecture.properties</h3>
                     <p>This error (seen in log files following a crash related to NBT) is basically Fabric shitting the bed over <i>something</i> in the NBT, despite there being no real issue.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The major downside to this bug is that it can prevent loading certain Kits and Items in a Minecraft instance that is using Fabric.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A common workaround is to load the Kits/Items in a Forge instance, then copy them over to fabric via a world save file.
